### Master's Thesis in Data Science (HSLU, ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­): Using LLMs to Extract Information from Sensitive Documents [Data Extraction Dashboard](https://embed-mt--e-dash-wide2rows1.replit.app) (hover over dots)

Developed an automated system for extracting and analyzing data from VC pitch decks, cutting costs to 2.50 francs per document, achieving a processing cost of approximately 2.50 francs per document, well below the target of 5-8 francs.
Tested using GPUs for OCR but found GPT-4o could already transcribe, making the pipeline much simpler & faster.

This required multimodal LLM processing of documents, automated web scrape summarisation, integrated observability tooling, and outputting summaries aligned with the firm's internal CRM system, based on extensive client-facing requirements engineering.

An example of the costs dashboard created using the [Pydantic Logfire](https://docs.pydantic.dev/logfire/guides/) observability platform is shown below.

**Technical Skills**:  Python, PyMuPDF, OCR, OpenAI API, MongoDB, Beanie, Apify (web scraping), data extraction, CRM integration.

**Business Skills**:  Designed and implemented fully automated data extraction & enrichment pipelines. Improved internal processes via client-facing requirements engineering and built observability dashboards for performance tracking. Introduced 3 key guiding metrics 'GenAI Reliability', 'Data Strategy', 'Minimising Costs'.

### Conference Presentation: PyCon Lithuania 2024 - [Structured Outputs from LLMs Using the "Instructor" Package](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7182057676166545408)

Succinctly showcasing the "[Instructor](useinstructor.com/)" open-source project at Python Lithuania 2024, illustrating how it leverages Pydantic to neatly manage LLM system-prompts, and avoid unreliable LLM outputs.

My early advocacy for the value of this structured prompting approach was validated 4 months later OpenAI when themselves implemented analogous functionality in their API, directly crediting the Open-Source community project "Instructor" as inspiration.

**Technical Skills**:  Technical communication, Instructor, Pydantic, OpenAI API, ensuring reliable LLM outputs.

**Business Skills**:  Advocated for structured prompting approach to improve LLM output reliability. Presented solution to 300 attendees, providing key insights into the direction AI-driven systems are developping.

### SmashCut - Tennis Without Time-Out = Computer Vision models to auto-generate highlight snippets from tennis matches (PyTorch, GPT4-vision, Dash): [https://is.gd/smashcut](https://is.gd/smashcut)

Developed a system to automatically identify and remove non-action segments from tennis broadcasts, significantly enhancing the viewer experience by focusing on actual gameplay while maintaining match flow.

Compared the performance of CNNs, autoencoders, and GPT-4 vision (zero-shot) classifiers in categorizing tennis video content, finding that CNNs performed best with curated data while GPT-4 showed better generalization to new domains.

Investigated unsupervised learning techniques to overcome data scarcity, successfully creating a prototype for scalable training dataset generation from publicly available tennis match videos. This can be used for social-media content generation, or for automatic benchmarking and performance analysis for professional analysis.

**Technical Skills**:  Self-supervised learning, YOLOv8, PyTorch Lightning, CNNs, Autoencoders, GPT-4 vision, DVC, Azure Blob Storage.

**Business Skills**:  Developed a system to remove dead-time from tennis broadcasts, enhancing viewer experience. Positioned the project for use in media production and professional sports analysis, showcasing its scalability for automated content creation and performance evaluation.

### Scrape & Visualisation of Swiss Gregorian Chant Manuscript Archive (MongoDB into Streamlit): [ecodices.replit.app/](https://ecodices.replit.app)

Scraped metadata for 2,827 ancient manuscripts into MongoDB, creating an interactive data dashboard visualising their age, location, format etc.

The project sets the stage to create computer vision datasets for training multi-modal LLMs to transcribe and analyse ancient manuscripts. For an ongoing follow-up project called "GNEWM: Gregorian Notation Extraction With MLLMs", using self-supervised learning on self-generated synthetic datasets.

Using AI to transcribe everything will enable researchers to make definitive claims like "Document X is the only surviving example we have of technique Y", or, to track the variations in the melodies of the same song across cultures and centuries.

**Technical Skills**:  BeautifulSoup, MongoDB, Streamlit, Replit, web scraping, data analysis, multithreading, custom Plotly dashboards.

**Business Skills**:  Developed a dashboard visualising metadata for 2,827 manuscripts, enabling future AI projects like optical character recognition for ancient music notation. Laid groundwork for multimodal LLMs to analyse rare manuscripts, empowering researchers to generate new insights from historical data.

### Clean Tech Chatbot (RAG using DeepLake in Streamlit): [https://cleantech.replit.app](https://cleantech.replit.app)

Implemented a RAG-powered chatbot in a resource-limited Replit environment, using BERTTopic for topic modeling and Sentence Transformers for embeddings.

This makes a vast corpus of clean energy and technology articles accessible and usable, such as generating a synthetic QnA traning dataset to fine-tuning a small language model for improved query responses.

Successfully overcame the technical challenges from the sentence embedding model running out of micro-server memory, by re-routing low-frequency queries through HuggingFace's free 'trial' API.

**Technical Skills**:  Small LLM Fine-Tuning, CUDA, Replit, Optimisation, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), BERTTopic, UMAP, HDBSCAN, SentenceTransformers, HuggingFace.

**Business Skills**:  Created an AI-powered chatbot to enhance accessibility to clean energy literature. Overcame technical resource constraints improving user access to clean tech resources through tailored query responses.

### Social Network Analysis of Indian Unicorn Startup Investments: [PDF](https://github.com/inn-0/portfolio/blob/main/The%20Business%20Social%20Networks%20of%20Indian%20Unicorn%20Startups.pdf)

A dataset on Indian Unicorn Startups was enriched with various web scraping (Google Maps API, Pitchdeck.com). Then network science of scale-free self-organising systems was applied to map the market, tracking how the the links between companies & co-investors were formed over time.

This revealed the importance of network positioning for investors, where those who got in early and stayed active in the market tended to preferentially accumulate more and connections, increasing their centrality & influence.

**Technical Skills**:  Plotly in Dash, Networkx, Google Maps API, OpenAI API, APIFY API, PitchBook.com.

**Business Skills**:  Mapped the social networks of Indian unicorn investors, identifying key patterns in investor influence and network centrality. Insights helped clients strategize their market positioning, offering an interactive report with in-depth network analysis and historic investor behaviour trends.
